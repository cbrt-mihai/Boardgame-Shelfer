All you have to do is:
1. Write all your games and their dimensions (in centimeters), as you see in the example "items.txt" file;
2. Write all your shelves and their dimensions (again, in centimeters), as you see in the example "bins.txt" file.

If you want to visualize the output, go here: https://editor.p5js.org/cbrt-mihai/sketches/k6b2igNEu
And paste the output file generated by the Python script in the output.txt file on the website. (Be careful not to have a blank line at the end)
